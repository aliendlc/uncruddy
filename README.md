Coffee Brain
Approach:
I own a coffee shop and roastery and thought something like this app could help and would be great for the team to use at work.
I focused on trying to connect everything properly at first and then built functionality and location.
I chose to develop this web app because I believe it would be great to have a web app log coffee profiles for professionals in the industry, and a great place for coffee enthusiasts to log their favorite coffees.
Some of the tools used to make this:

JavaScript, Express, EJS, Mongodb, mongo, mongoose, heroku, github, node.js, html, css, materialize.

A few highlights for the app:
A user is the only one that can see his cups and roasts underneath the same headers. The user is also the only one that has access to the edit/delete buttons for the entries. These were a couple of if else statements.
Posting cups, roasts, mycups, and myroasts took a little while to figure it but that chunk of code looks pretty good. (server.js)

The community sections allow users to share their profiles. All profiles created get posted to the community boards.

Logo was created for this web app. At first I thought about using Gordon Johnson's royalty free image from pixabay. I then decided to base my own design on his and add color to the other side of the brain. All colors from the right side of the brain were made by me as well as the black lines of the brain. Some of the lines were drawn close to the original, especially the border. So, thank you Gordon Johnson!

Going forward:
-adding sorting and search functionality to the entries displayed
-being able to include a picture
-a carousel with user pictures
-link to flavor wheel: one image is included in the files and is by Counter Culture Coffee - I wasn't sure if I was able to use it but wanted to incorporate it in the notes section of the coffee entries. (I have also been thinking of making my own flavor wheel)
-adding an in-app timer that would allow for a user to plug in his own timer
-fixing DATE format!
